\begin{abstract}
Publication fees in open access publishing hold a prominent place on the agenda of researchers, policy-makers, and academic publishers. This paper contributes to the evolving empirical basis on open access funding. It describes the Open APC initiative, in which German universities and research organizations share their expenditures for publication fees. As method, the initiative uses existing open data tools to aggregate and disseminate institutional spending on open access publication fees. In total, 29 German research organizations self-reported funding of 6,279 open access journal articles, which amounted to 8,039,339\,\euro. The average payment for each article was 1,280\,\euro, and the median payment 1,209\,\euro. Our data-set comprises only 53 articles in hybrid journals. With an indexing coverage of 99\,\%, the findings reveal that the DOI agency CrossRef provides both comprehensive bibliographic coverage of the funded open access journal literature and disambiguated names of journal titles and publishing houses. We show that authority control of these bibliographic information is particularly relevant for the comparative study of the economical effects of open access publishing.
