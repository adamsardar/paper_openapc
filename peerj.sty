\begin{abstract}
Publication fees as revenue source in open access publishing hold a prominent place on the agenda of researchers, policy makers, and academic publishers. This study contributes to the evolving empirical basis on funding these charges. Drawing on self-reported data from 30 German universities and research organisations between 2005 and 2015, expenditure on open access publication fee increased over the years in Germany. Spending amounted to 9,627,537 \euro. The average payment was 1,298 \euro, and the median 1,231 \euro. 94\' \% of the total article volume included in the study was supported in accordance with the price cap of 2,000 \euro, a limit imposed by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) as part of its funding activities for universities' open access funds. Expenditure varied considerably at the institutional level. There were also differences in how much the institutions spent per journal and publisher. This reflects, at least in parts, that varying pricing schemes leading to discounted publication fees were in place. With an indexing coverage of 99\' \%, Crossref, a DOI minting agency for scholarly literature that also provides bibliographic metadata, thoroughly indexed the open access journals articles included in the study. A comparison with related openly available cost data from Austria (FWF) and the UK (Wellcome Trust, Jisc) shows that German universities and research organisations mostly funded fully open access journal articles. By contrast, hybrid journal articles accounted for the largest share of spending according to the Austrian and UK data. Fees paid for hybrid journals were on average more expensive than fully open access journals.
